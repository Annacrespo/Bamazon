# Node.js & MySQL
## Overview
A CLI Amazon-like storefront app with the MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app will track product sales across the store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.

Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).
Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.
Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.
